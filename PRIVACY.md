**WebAI Chrome Extension Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: April 26, 2025

Thank you for using WebAI! This privacy policy explains how the WebAI Chrome extension ("WebAI", "the extension", "we", "us") handles your information. Our core principle is privacy through local processing: WebAI is designed to interact with Large Language Model (LLM) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services that *you* host and control.

**1. Information We Process**

WebAI processes the following information solely to provide its features:

*   **Webpage Content:** When you activate WebAI on a webpage (e.g., by clicking "Summarize" or asking a question), the text content of that active webpage is extracted. This may include text from HTML pages or extracted text from PDF documents viewed in the browser.
*   **User Input:** Questions or prompts you type into the WebAI interface.
*   **Service Endpoints:** The URLs you provide in the extension's options for your self-hosted LLM and TTS services (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`).
*   **Selected LLM Model:** The specific LLM model you choose from the dropdown list provided by your LLM service.
*   **Conversation History:** The sequence of your questions and the corresponding AI-generated answers for specific webpages. This includes metadata like the LLM model used and processing duration for responses.
*   **AI Responses:** Text generated by your LLM service in response to summaries or questions.
*   **Audio Data:** If you use the "Listen" feature, the text of the AI response is sent to your TTS service, and the resulting audio data is received and played back by the extension.

**2. How We Use Information**

Your information is used exclusively for the following purposes within the extension:

*   **To Summarize Content:** Webpage content is sent to your configured LLM endpoint to generate a summary.
*   **To Answer Questions:** Webpage content, conversation history, and your questions are sent to your configured LLM endpoint to generate answers.
*   **To Configure Services:** Your LLM and TTS endpoint URLs are stored so the extension can communicate with your local services.
*   **To Remember Preferences:** Your selected LLM model is saved for convenience.
*   **To Provide Conversation History:** Questions and answers are stored locally, associated with the webpage URL, allowing you to resume conversations when revisiting a page.
*   **To Enable Text-to-Speech:** Text from AI responses is sent to your configured TTS endpoint to generate audio upon your request.
*   **To Enable Copying:** The `clipboardWrite` permission allows you to copy text from the extension interface to your clipboard when you click the "Copy" button.
*   **To Enable Deletion/Regeneration:** Allows modification of the locally stored conversation history based on user actions (delete message, regenerate response).

**3. Data Storage and Security**

*   **Local Storage:** Your LLM/TTS endpoint configurations and selected model preference are stored using `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync across browsers where you are logged into your Google account. Your conversation history (questions, answers, metadata) for each webpage is stored using `chrome.storage.local`, which is specific to the browser installation where the extension is running.
*   **Data Transmission:** WebAI **only** transmits data (webpage content, questions, text for TTS) to the LLM and TTS endpoint URLs that **you** explicitly configure in the extension's options. The security of this transmission depends on the configuration of your local services (e.g., using HTTP or HTTPS). WebAI itself does not add encryption beyond what your browser provides for the connection to your specified endpoints.
*   **No Developer Access:** We, the developers of WebAI, do not have access to your webpage content, questions, conversation history, or your service endpoints. All processing involving your content happens between your browser and your configured services.

**4. Data Sharing**

WebAI **does not share your information with any third parties**.

Data is sent *only* to the LLM and TTS service endpoints that *you* configure. You are responsible for the privacy practices of the LLM and TTS services you choose to run and configure.

**5. Permissions Justification**

WebAI requires the following Chrome permissions for its core functionality:

*   `activeTab`: To access the content of the webpage you are currently viewing *only when you interact with the extension* (e.g., click the icon, summarize, ask).
*   `scripting`: To inject a script into the active tab to extract its text content for processing. Also used to potentially interact with PDF viewers embedded in pages.
*   `storage`: To save your configured service endpoints, selected model, and conversation history locally within your browser (`chrome.storage.sync` and `chrome.storage.local`).
*   `clipboardWrite`: To allow you to copy text from the extension's interface using the "Copy" button, *only upon your click*.
*   `host_permissions` (e.g., `<all_urls>`): Required to allow the extension to send requests *only* to the LLM and TTS API endpoints you specify in the options. `<all_urls>` is requested to provide flexibility, allowing users to configure endpoints on `localhost`, local network addresses, or potentially other user-controlled servers. This permission is also necessary for fetching PDF content directly via `fetch` when the active tab URL points to a PDF file.

**6. User Choices and Control**

*   **Configuration:** You control which LLM and TTS services are used by configuring their endpoints in the extension's options page.
*   **History Management:** You can clear the conversation history for the current page using the "Clear" button within the extension popup. You can also delete individual messages.
*   **Disabling/Uninstalling:** You can disable or uninstall the WebAI extension at any time through Chrome's extension management page (`chrome://extensions/`). Uninstalling the extension will remove its locally stored data, including conversation history and settings.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
